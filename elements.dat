//An example of how to define elements for Sand 2.0 by Brian Jackson

//First, (optionally), you can put the names of elements you want to include in your menu
//If you don't specify this, all elements you declare are automatically included
//If you do specify a menu, *only* the specified elements can be drawn by the user
//Also, this allows you to rearrange elements into whatever order you like
menu 
     //The first ten elements get mapped to keys 0-9
     Air, Wall, Sand, Water, Oil, Salt,
     SaltWater, Plant, Wood, Fire, 
     //The rest can still be selected by using the arrow keys
     HiFire, Snow, Steam, HiPressureSteam,
     Torch, Spout, 
     Napalm, CementPowder,
     Ozone, MoltenMetal, Metal,
     Acetylene, AcetyleneEmitter, Fuse, 
     Radiation


//Each element starts with the keyword "element" and a (usually) capitalized name
//Note that Air and Wall are always included by default, and don't need to be added;
//however, they would be given default properties, which are totally
//uninteresting

//Each element can have the following properties:
//color, density, pressure, react, decay

element Air
	color 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 //Colors must be specified r, g, b in the range 0.0 - 1.0
	density 0.0 //If density isn't specified, the element will be unaffected by gravity - otherwise heavy elements sink and light ones rise
	pressure 0.0 //Certain elements can overwrite elements with a zero pressure. Default is pressure 1.0.
	react Torch: Fire 1.0 //100% chance that air touching torch bursts into flames - effectively, torch spawns fire
	react Spout: Water 1.0 //Same for spout and water
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0 //Same for radiation - it's self-propagating
