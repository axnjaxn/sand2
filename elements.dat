//An example of how to define elements for Sand 2.0 by Brian Jackson

//Each element starts with the keyword "element" and a (usually) capitalized name
//Note that Air and Wall are always included by default, and don't need to be added;
//however, they would be given default properties, which are totally
//uninteresting

//Each element can have the following properties:
//color, density, react, decay

element Air
	color 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 //Colors must be specified r, g, b in the range 0.0 - 1.0
	density 0.0 //If density isn't specified, the element will be unaffected by gravity
	react Torch: Fire 1.0 //100% chance that air touching torch bursts into flames - effectively, torch spawns fire
	react Spout: Water 1.0 //Same for spout and water
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0 //Same for radiation - it's self-propagating

element Wall
	color 0.75, 0.75, 0.75
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0

element Sand 
	color 1.0, 0.75, 0.25
	density 2.0 //Density is arbitrary, but the denser elements seek the bottom
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0

element SaltWater
	color 0.25, 0.25, 0.75
	density 1.25

	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0
	decay Salt 0.0005, Water 0.0005 //If the element decays (changes without needing to touch anything) it looks like this
