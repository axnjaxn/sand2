//An example of how to define elements for Sand 2.0 by Brian Jackson

//First, there's a comma-separated list of element names
//This is used internally to compute the size of the element table
//and assign each name to an id number

//Note that Air and Wall are always included by default, and don't need to be added
//Air, Wall,
Sand, Water, Oil, Salt, Saltwater, Plant, Wood, Fire, Steam,
Torch, Spout, Napalm, CementPowder, CementMix, Radiation, Fallout

//Next, there's the element properties
//Each element starts with the keyword "element" and a (usually) capitalized name
//Each element can have the following properties:
//color, density, react, decay

element Air
	color 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 //Colors must be specified r, g, b in the range 0.0 - 1.0
	//If density isn't specified, the element will be unaffected by gravity
	react Torch: fire 1.0
	react Spout: water 1.0
	react Radiation: radiation 1.0 //This gives a 100% chance that air touching radiation will become radiation

element Wall
	color 0.75, 0.75, 0.75
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0

element Sand 
	color 1.0, 0.75, 0.25
	density 2.0 //Density is arbitrary, but the denser elements seek the bottom
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0

element Water
	color 0.0, 0.0, 1.0
	density 1.0
	react Salt: Saltwater 0.1

element Salt
	color 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
	density 1.5

element SaltWater
	color 0.25, 0.25, 0.75
	density 1.25
	react Fire: Salt 0.5, Water 0.5 //This is an example of multiple reactions - each one has a probability of 50%
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0
	react Fallout: Fallout 1.0
	decay Salt 0.001, Water 0.001 //If the element decays (changes without needing to touch anything) it looks like this

element Plant
	color 0.0, 1.0, 0.0
