This is called "sand2" because it's my second attempt at a clone of the Falling 
Sand Game that was popular a few years ago.

It's not super-detailed or super-geared towards collaboration and open source 
workflow - that much I'm aware of. I might re-comment things, but for now it's 
intended to be proof-of-concept. 

My goals were to show that:
1. SDL 2.0 isn't super scary
2. Flex and Bison can be used in conjunction with a C++ system of classes
3. The Falling Sand Game could be kind of neat when you can completely 
configure the elements to behave as you please.

If everything works out alright, this test project will also teach me to use 
GitHub as opposed to just local Git repositories.

Dependencies:
- SDL 2.0
- Flex and Bison
- Patience? :D
