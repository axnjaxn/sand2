//An example of how to define elements for Sand 2.0 by Brian Jackson
//I've since extended the table

//First, (optionally), you can put the names of elements you want to include in your menu
//If you don't specify this, all elements you declare are automatically included
//If you do specify a menu, *only* the specified elements can be drawn by the user
//Also, this allows you to rearrange elements into whatever order you like
menu Air, Wall, Sand, Water, Oil, Salt,
     SaltWater, Plant, Wood, Fire, HiFire, Steam,
     Torch, Spout, Napalm, CementPowder,
     Ozone, MoltenMetal, HotMetal, Metal,
     Acetylene, Radiation


//Each element starts with the keyword "element" and a (usually) capitalized name
//Note that Air and Wall are always included by default, and don't need to be added;
//however, they would be given default properties, which are totally
//uninteresting

//Each element can have the following properties:
//color, density, react, decay

element Air
	color 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 //Colors must be specified r, g, b in the range 0.0 - 1.0
	density 0.0 //If density isn't specified, the element will be unaffected by gravity
	react Torch: Fire 1.0 //100% chance that air touching torch bursts into flames - effectively, torch spawns fire
	react Spout: Water 1.0 //Same for spout and water
	react Radiation: Radiation 1.0 //Same for radiation - it's self-propagating
